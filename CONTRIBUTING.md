## Guidelines

### Linting

Use the provided `.eslintrc.json` to lint your files, include any ignores in your pull request documentation with a reason why.


### Running

1. Get a bot token from the [discord application dashboard here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) and use it in a copy of `pm2.json`, we ignore `genesis.json` by default in our `.gitignore`. 

2. Install [pm2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/).

3. Add any other applicable tokens to `genesis.json` (or whatever you called it).

4. Run `pm2 start genesis.json` to start the bot.

5. View logs in `pm2 logs genesis-test` if you wish to see logs for the process.

6. Invite the bot to your server using the format:

`https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?scope=bot&client_id=<bot_client_id>&permissions=<permissions###>`.
